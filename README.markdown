## 🎨 What’s This All About?

Imagine a world where grainy, low-res, or damaged images are transformed into crisp, vibrant masterpieces. That’s what **AI Image Restoration** does! Powered by deep learning wizardry, this project lets you:
- 🧼 **Denoise**: Wipe away noise like a digital sponge, leaving your images crystal clear.
- 🔍 **Super-Resolution**: Zoom in without the blur—turn pixelated pics into high-def wonders.
- 🖌️ **Inpainting**: Magically reconstruct missing pieces, like an artist filling in a torn canvas.
- 🛠️ **Customizable**: Tweak the pipeline to match your creative vision.

This isn’t just code—it’s a canvas for your imagination! 🎭

## 🪄 How to Work the Magic

1. **Gather Your Ingredients**: Drop your images into the `input/` folder. Got a blurry vacation photo? A scratched family portrait? We’ve got you covered!
2. **Cast the Spell**: Use our scripts to transform your images. For example:
   ```bash
   python restore.py --input input/fuzzy_photo.jpg --output output/sharp_masterpiece.jpg --model super_resolution
   ```
   Choose your spell: `denoising`, `super_resolution`, or `inpainting`.
3. **Admire the Result**: Find your rejuvenated images in the `output/` folder, ready to steal the show!

### Example Spell
Want to turn a low-res image into a high-def stunner? Try this:
```bash
python restore.py --input input/old_pic.jpg --output output/crisp_pic.jpg --model super_resolution
```
